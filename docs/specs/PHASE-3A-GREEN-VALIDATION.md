**Beast Deployment Date:** [FROM CHECKPOINT]
**Reviewer:** Chromebook Orchestrator (Claude Sonnet 4.5)
**Status:** üü¢ APPROVED / ‚ö†Ô∏è CONDITIONAL / ‚ùå REJECTED

---

## üéØ Purpose

This checklist is for the **Orchestrator** to validate Beast's Phase 3A deployment before final approval.

**Workflow:** Beast executes (RED) ‚Üí Orchestrator validates (GREEN) ‚Üí Approve (CHECKPOINT)

---

## üìã Pre-Review Setup

```bash
# On Chromebook: Pull latest from GitHub
cd ~/dev-vault
git pull origin main

# Verify checkpoint document exists
ls -lah docs/checkpoints/PHASE-3A-CHECKPOINT-APPROVAL.md

# Read Beast's checkpoint report
cat docs/checkpoints/PHASE-3A-CHECKPOINT-APPROVAL.md
```

---

## ‚úÖ GREEN Validation Tests (Run from Chromebook)

### Test 1: Verify Deployment Artifacts Exist

```bash
cd ~/dev-vault

# Check all expected files were created
ls -lah deployment/policies/app-example.hcl
ls -lah deployment/scripts/fetch-secrets.sh
ls -lah deployment/examples/docker-compose-pattern1.yml
ls -lah deployment/examples/example-app/server.js
ls -lah deployment/examples/PATTERN1-USAGE.md
ls -lah docs/checkpoints/PHASE-3A-CHECKPOINT-APPROVAL.md

# Verify script is executable
test -x deployment/scripts/fetch-secrets.sh && echo "‚úÖ Script is executable" || echo "‚ùå Script not executable"
```

**Expected:** All files exist, script is executable

**Result:** [ ] PASS / [ ] FAIL
**Notes:**

---

### Test 2: Remote Vault Validation (via SSH)

```bash
# SSH to Beast and verify AppRole is enabled
ssh jamesb@192.168.68.100 'export VAULT_ADDR="http://192.168.68.100:8200" && vault auth list' | grep approle

# Expected: approle/ present in output
```

**Expected:** AppRole authentication method listed

**Result:** [ ] PASS / [ ] FAIL
**Notes:**

---

### Test 3: Policy Validation (via SSH)

```bash
# Verify app-example policy exists and is correct
ssh jamesb@192.168.68.100 'export VAULT_ADDR="http://192.168.68.100:8200" && vault policy read app-example'

# Check policy grants read access to secret/data/apps/example/*
# Check policy denies access to other paths
```

**Expected:** Policy content matches spec, proper access controls

**Result:** [ ] PASS / [ ] FAIL
**Notes:**

---

### Test 4: AppRole Configuration Check (via SSH)

```bash
# Verify example-app AppRole exists with correct TTLs
ssh jamesb@192.168.68.100 'export VAULT_ADDR="http://192.168.68.100:8200" && vault read auth/approle/role/example-app'

# Expected:
# - token_ttl: 1h (3600s)
# - token_max_ttl: 24h (86400s)
# - policies: ["app-example"]
# - bind_secret_id: true
```

**Expected:** AppRole configured with correct TTLs and policy

**Result:** [ ] PASS / [ ] FAIL
**Notes:**

---

### Test 5: Test Secrets Exist (via SSH)

```bash
# Verify test secrets were created
ssh jamesb@192.168.68.100 'export VAULT_ADDR="http://192.168.68.100:8200" && vault kv list secret/apps/example/'

# Expected: database/ and api-keys/ listed
```

**Expected:** Test secrets exist under secret/apps/example/

**Result:** [ ] PASS / [ ] FAIL
**Notes:**

---

### Test 6: Code Quality Review

```bash
# Review fetch-secrets.sh script
cat deployment/scripts/fetch-secrets.sh | grep -A5 "set -e"

# Verify:
# - Has error handling (set -e)
# - Has input validation (required env vars)
# - Has logging (log_info, log_error)
# - Supports 3 output formats (env, json, export)
# - Has clear documentation/comments
```

**Expected:** Script has proper error handling and documentation

**Result:** [ ] PASS / [ ] FAIL
**Notes:**

---

### Test 7: Docker Example Review

```bash
# Review docker-compose example
cat deployment/examples/docker-compose-pattern1.yml

# Verify:
# - Uses environment variables for credentials
# - Mounts fetch-secrets.sh script
# - Has proper entrypoint command
# - Documented with comments
```

**Expected:** Docker example follows best practices

**Result:** [ ] PASS / [ ] FAIL
**Notes:**

---

### Test 8: Documentation Completeness

```bash
# Verify usage documentation exists and is complete
cat deployment/examples/PATTERN1-USAGE.md | grep -E "Quick Start|Security Best Practices|Troubleshooting"

# Check for:
# - Quick start guide
# - Usage examples
# - Security best practices
# - Troubleshooting section
# - Clear instructions for developers
```

**Expected:** Documentation is comprehensive and helpful

**Result:** [ ] PASS / [ ] FAIL
**Notes:**

---

### Test 9: Checkpoint Document Review

```bash
# Review Beast's checkpoint document
cat docs/checkpoints/PHASE-3A-CHECKPOINT-APPROVAL.md

# Verify:
# - All sections filled out
# - Execution time documented
# - All 6 validation tests marked pass/fail
# - Any issues documented
# - Rollback procedure included
```

**Expected:** Checkpoint document is complete and accurate

**Result:** [ ] PASS / [ ] FAIL
**Notes:**

---

### Test 10: Git History Verification

```bash
# Check commit message and changes
git log -1 --pretty=format:"%h - %s%n%b"
git show --name-status HEAD

# Verify:
# - Descriptive commit message
# - All expected files in commit
# - No unexpected changes
# - Follows commit message conventions
```

```

**Expected:** TTLs are reasonable (1h / 24h max)

**Result:** [ ] PASS / [ ] FAIL

---

### Security Check 2: Policy Least Privilege

```bash
# Verify policy only grants access to app-specific path
